**Hi there!** ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aastha, a second-year Computer Science major at Virginia Tech.

I'm currently learning about Cloud Software Development and GUI programming.<br />
I'm interested in building interactive games with an aesthetic UI.<br />
Outside of technology, I am facinated by the advancements of AI as well as designing and making art.<br />
