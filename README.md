## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Aastha, a second-year Computer Science major at Virginia Tech.

I'm currently learning about Cloud Software Development and GUI programming. 
I'm interested in building interactive games with an aesthetic UI.
Outside of technology, I am facinated by the advancements of AI as well as designing and making art.
